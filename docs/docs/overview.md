Mirror is a compiling, testing and deployment for Hyperledger Besu, aiming to make life as an Enterprise Ethereum developer easier.

Mirror is a CLI tool similar to Ethereum DApp development tools such as Truffle, but it is designed to
support all the Enterprise features developed on Hyperledger Besu. We have included all the frequently used commands (init, compile, deploy, test) of the truffle tool in our initial release.


Some of the features are:

* Initialize a bare contract project
* Deploy the contracts using privacy transactions
* Write Mocha tests for privacy transactions
